      // Note: If you paused on a different line, you have a browser extension 
      // that registers a click event listener on every page that you visit. 
      // You were paused in the extension's click listener. If you use Incognito Mode to browse in private, 
      // which disables all extensions, you can see that you pause on the correct line of code every time.
